{member} did an amazing job. I was happy with how quick my order was taken and how fast I received my food.
I come to this taco bell because I know {member} always gets my order right! I can't thank them enough
I come here on my lunch break from work and {member} always ensures that wait time is minimal
you can tell that {member} loves working for taco bell, I never have any issues at this location because of them.
amazing worker, always puts a smile on my face
very courteous and always a fast checkout
